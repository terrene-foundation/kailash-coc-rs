/**
 * cross-repo-authorize — write the User-Authorized Exception receipt that
 * clears a bounded cross-repo action, in a location a NORMAL (non-codify)
 * session can write.
 *
 * Closes the RC6 deadlock (journal/0488): `repo-scope-discipline.md`
 * § User-Authorized Exception condition 4 requires a journaled receipt BEFORE
 * a cross-repo action, but `journal/` is `/codify`-gated by the integrity
 * guard — so the receipt the hook (`violation-patterns.js::
 * hasCrossRepoAuthorizationReceipt`) greps was structurally un-producible
 * outside a codify session, and the exception was unsatisfiable in exactly the
 * sessions (normal downstream work) where it is needed.
 *
 * The receipt lives at `.claude/cross-repo-authz/<date>-<slug>-<digest>.md` — NOT
 * under `journal/`, NOT under the integrity-guarded `.claude/learning/`. It is a
 * working-tree file, greppable while it is INSIDE the guard's authorization
 * window (derived from the receipt's own `timestamp:` frontmatter, NOT from file
 * mtime and NOT from the filename's date — see `readReaderWindows` below);
 * ENFORCEMENT never consults git, so an uncommitted receipt clears
 * `repo-scope-discipline.md` condition 4 identically to a committed one.
 *
 * WHETHER to commit it is REPO-CLASS-dependent (2026-08-03, the LOCALITY axis —
 * see `readRepoClass` / `shouldCommitReceipt` below). At loom (`coc-source`) the
 * receipt is a durable forensic witness and committing is disclosure-safe: it is
 * in NO sync tier and is excluded-by-default from the positive-INCLUDE publish
 * allowlist, so it never cascades to a consumer. Those fences govern content
 * flowing OUT OF LOOM and cover NOTHING written into another repo, so at a BUILD
 * repo / USE template / downstream consumer the receipt stays LOCAL — loom's sync
 * gitignores the directory there (`sync-manifest.yaml::target_owned`,
 * `publish: local_only`). The pre-2026-08-03 tool printed and stamped
 * an unconditional "commit it", which is how kailash-py and kailash-rs came to
 * track operator-correlatable receipts in a public-fork-lane history.
 *
 * This tool ONLY writes the receipt (the un-typo-able marker + the five
 * conditions). The AGENT drives the restate→user-confirm ceremony in chat per
 * `.claude/commands/cross-repo-authorize.md`; the tool is invoked AFTER the
 * user confirms, so no receipt lands without a confirmed authorization.
 *
 * Tier semantics (D — journal/0488): a WRITE receipt carries all five
 * conditions (the receipt is the sole distinguisher between an authorized and
 * an unauthorized cross-repo WRITE — byte-identical in the target's history).
 * A user-directed READ carries conditions 1+2+3+5 with condition-4 downgraded
 * to this one-line affordance receipt (NOT eliminated) — a read leaves no
 * durable trace in the target, so condition 4 protects a failure mode reads do
 * not have.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node .claude/bin/cross-repo-authorize.mjs \
 *     --target <owner/repo> --action "<bounded action>" \
 *     --instruction "<verbatim user instruction>" --mode <read|write> \
 *     [--requester <display_id>] [--repo-root <path>] [--json]
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = receipt written; 1 = usage / validation error.

// The slug is TRUNCATED to 48 chars for human readability, and truncation
// discards exactly the discriminating tail: every Step-7c action opens with the
// same words ("file a Step-7c upflow proposal PR to the template inbox for
// ..."), so two genuinely distinct same-day authorizations against one target
// collapsed to ONE filename. Before this discriminator the second write
// SILENTLY DESTROYED the first receipt (`writeFileSync` with no `wx`), and a
// receipt is the ONLY thing distinguishing an authorized cross-repo action from
// an unauthorized one (`repo-scope-discipline.md` § User-Authorized Exception
// condition 4 — "present = in-scope, absent = critical L1").
//
// The digest is taken over the FULL, UNTRUNCATED (target, action, mode) triple,
// so it discriminates precisely where the slug stops. Consequences, both wanted:
//   - distinct actions  -> distinct digests -> both receipts survive;
//   - an identical re-run while the prior receipt is still LIVE -> identical
//     digest -> same path -> refused, which is correct (that receipt really does
//     still authorize the action, and overwriting would destroy an audit record);
//   - an identical re-run after that receipt has EXPIRED -> a fresh receipt at a
//     NEW path, because the expired one authorizes nothing (`writeReceiptImmutable`).
// `mode` is in the triple because a read receipt and a write receipt for the
// same action are DISTINCT authorizations at different tiers (a read receipt
// must never clear a write), so they must never collide onto one filename.
//
// SCOPE — the digest discriminates FILENAMES by action. It does NOT scope
// AUTHORITY by action, and nothing here does. The guard builds its marker regex
// from (target, mode) ONLY (`violation-patterns.js::hasCrossRepoAuthorizationReceipt`,
// ~L183-186); the action text never enters the authorization decision. So ONE
// live receipt for (target, write) clears ANY cross-repo write against that
// target for the whole window, whatever action it names.
// `repo-scope-discipline.md` § User-Authorized Exception condition 5 ("only the
// named action against only the named repo") is therefore ATTESTED in every
// receipt and STRUCTURALLY UNENFORCED. Closing that is a reader-side change
// (the marker would have to carry an action digest the guard also computes from
// the intercepted command) and is deliberately NOT attempted here — do not read
// this digest as if it already did it.
//
// 8 hex chars (32 bits) is sized for human-scannable filenames, not collision
// resistance: this discriminates a handful of same-day receipts in one
// directory, and a digest collision degrades to the pre-existing refusal (a
// loud `wx` failure), never to a silent overwrite.

 * Read this repo's CLASS from `.claude/VERSION::type` — the discriminator

 * Used for exactly one decision: whether the receipt should be COMMITTED. That
 * is a repo-class property, not a content property — see `shouldCommitReceipt`.
 *
 * TRAP (loom#1426) — DO NOT widen this reader into a general trust input. It
 * parses `.claude/VERSION` and returns `type` VERBATIM: no signature, no
 * cross-check, no corroborating source. The `catch` fails closed on an
 * UNREADABLE file only; it cannot fail closed on a file that reads fine and
 * lies. So the class is attacker-authorable by anyone who can write a JSON file
 * in the repo, and every consumer of it inherits that.
 *
 * That is survivable HERE precisely because of the polarity `shouldCommitReceipt`
 * chose: only `coc-source` may commit, so a DEMOTION (any other value, or an
 * unreadable file) costs a durable audit trail and nothing else, while the
 * dangerous direction — a repo forging `coc-source` to be told "commit it" and

 * polarity, or that routes a second decision through the same field, converts a
 * lost audit trail into a real forge. `manifest-source.mjs::readRepoClass` is the
 * sibling reader with the same verbatim-trust property (loom#1399).
 *
 * Why this trap is recorded on THIS function rather than on the guard it
 * concerns: loom#1426 is the state-file write guard over-blocking read-only
 * commands that merely MENTION a protected path — it has now fired on five
 * separate actors, EVERY one of them while verifying or documenting the guard
 * itself, and in three of those cases the actor changed the TOOL rather than the
 * assertion being tested. The recurring conclusion is that the MATCHER is wrong
 * (it keys on a protected-path literal appearing anywhere in the command, not on
 * that path being the write TARGET), not that the policy should be relaxed —
 * relaxing removes a real control to fix a semantics bug. The narrowing
 * direction the issue's residuals (k)/(l)/(m) leave open is destination-
 * awareness: decide on the redirect target. This function is where a maintainer
 * reaching for "make it repo-class-aware" would arrive, and it is exactly the

<!--
  This receipt is the ONLY distinguisher between an authorized and an
  unauthorized cross-repo action. It is written by
  .claude/bin/cross-repo-authorize.mjs AFTER the user confirmed the restated
  action+target in chat, and BEFORE the action runs. The hook
  (violation-patterns.js::hasCrossRepoAuthorizationReceipt) greps this file's
  marker line in the WORKING TREE — not in git — so enforcement does not depend
  on whether this file is committed. Authorization EXPIRES: the guard bounds a
  receipt's age by the "timestamp:" field above (not file mtime, not the
  filename's date), so it stops clearing anything once that window elapses. Re-run
  the ceremony for a fresh one; it will not overwrite this record.

  ${localityNote}
