# Agent Orchestration Rules

See `.claude/guides/rule-extracts/agents.md` for full evidence, extended examples, post-mortems, recovery-protocol commands, the gate-review table, and CLI-syntax variants.


## Specialist Delegation (MUST)

When working with Kailash frameworks, MUST consult the relevant specialist: **dataflow-specialist** (DB/DataFlow), **nexus-specialist** (API/deployment), **kaizen-specialist** (AI agents), **mcp-specialist** (MCP integration), **mcp-platform-specialist** (FastMCP platform), **pact-specialist** (governance), **ml-specialist** (ML lifecycle), **align-specialist** (LLM fine-tuning). See `rules/framework-first.md` for the domain-to-framework binding.

**Why:** Specialists encode hard-won patterns generalist agents miss, preventing subtle API misuse.

## Specs Context in Delegation (MUST)

Every specialist delegation prompt MUST include relevant spec file content from `specs/`. Read `specs/_index.md`, select relevant files, include them inline. See `rules/specs-authority.md` MUST Rule 7 for the full protocol.

**Why:** Specialists without domain context produce technically correct but intent-misaligned output (e.g., schemas missing tenant_id).

## Analysis Chain (Complex Features)

1. **analyst** → Identify failure points
2. **analyst** → Break down requirements
3. **`decide-framework` skill** → Choose approach
4. Then appropriate specialist

## Parallel Execution

When multiple independent operations are needed, launch agents in parallel via the CLI's delegation primitive, wait for all, aggregate results. MUST NOT run sequentially when parallel is possible.

**Why:** Sequential execution of independent operations wastes the autonomous execution multiplier, turning a 1-session task into a multi-session bottleneck.

**See also**: `rules/time-pressure-discipline.md` — under time-pressure framings, parallelization IS the throughput response; procedure drops are BLOCKED even when the user authorizes them.

### MUST: Decompose Onto The Parallel Primitive By Default When The Work Earns It

When the work surface is **≥3 independent items** OR has a **multi-stage shape**, the orchestrator MUST decompose onto the runtime's parallel orchestration primitive by DEFAULT — not only under `/autonomize`. A genuinely serial single-item task MUST stay serial. Governance per `rules/governed-throughput.md`; throttle-aware per `rules/worktree-isolation.md` Rule 4.

```text
# DO — 3 independent shards → one parallel wave
# DO NOT — 1 serial rewrite → stay serial
```

**Why:** Parallel decomposition is the baseline throughput response, not a per-session opt-in; the serial-single-item gate prevents over-decomposition of genuinely sequential work.

### MUST: Parallel Brief-Claim Verification When Issue Count ≥ 3

When `/analyze` runs against a brief covering ≥ 3 distinct issues, the orchestrator MUST launch parallel deep-dive verification agents — one per claim cluster — to independently re-grep / re-read every factual claim. Inaccuracies MUST be recorded in the workspace journal AND the plan's "Brief corrections" section AS THE GATE before `/todos`. Single-agent analysis on a ≥3-issue brief is BLOCKED.

(See **Example 1** in the examples slot below for CLI-specific dispatch syntax.)

**Why:** Briefs reflect the author's mental model, which decays as code evolves; single-agent analysis cannot resist the brief's framing without independent reading. Parallel deep-dive verification is the structural defense — N agents, N claim-clusters, one wall-clock unit.

## Quality Gates (MUST — Gate-Level Review)

Reviews happen at COC phase boundaries, not per-edit. Skip only when explicitly told to. **MUST gates** are `/implement` and `/release`; reviewer + security-reviewer (and gold-standards-validator at `/release`) run as parallel background agents. RECOMMENDED gates run at `/analyze`, `/todos`, `/redteam`, `/codify`, and post-merge. See guide for the full gate table.

**Why:** Skipped gate reviews let gaps propagate downstream where they are far more expensive to fix.

(See **Example 2** in the examples slot below for the background-dispatch pattern.)

**BLOCKED responses when skipping MUST gates:** "Skipping review to save time" / "Reviews will happen in a follow-up session" / "The changes are straightforward, no review needed" / "Already reviewed informally during implementation".

### MUST: Reviewer Prompts Include Mechanical AST/Grep Sweep

Every gate-level reviewer prompt MUST include explicit mechanical sweeps that verify ABSOLUTE state (not only the diff). LLM-judgment review catches what's wrong with new code; mechanical sweeps catch what's missing from OLD code the spec also touched.

(See **Example 3** in the examples slot below for a mechanical-sweep reviewer prompt.)

**Why:** Reviewers are constrained by the diff; the `orphan-detection.md` §1 failure mode is invisible at diff-level. A 4-second `grep -c` catches what LLM judgment misses. See guide.

### MUST: Holistic Post-Multi-Wave Redteam Before Plan Close

A plan shipped across ≥3 sharded waves MUST run ONE holistic redteam round across ALL merged shards on main — ≥3 parallel reviewers (reviewer + security-reviewer + closure-parity verifier) scoped to the union of merged PRs, not the latest shard's diff — BEFORE the plan is declared converged.

**Why:** Per-shard redteams see only their own diff; cross-shard invariant breaks are invisible to every one of them. Evidence, BLOCKED corpus + posture wiring: guide § Holistic Post-Multi-Wave Redteam.

## Zero-Tolerance

Pre-existing failures MUST be fixed (`rules/zero-tolerance.md` Rule 1). No workarounds for SDK bugs — deep-dive and fix directly (Rule 4).

**Why:** Workarounds create parallel implementations that diverge from the SDK, doubling maintenance cost.

## MUST: Verify Specialist Tool Inventory Before Implementation Delegation

When delegating IMPLEMENTATION work (file edits, commits, build/test invocation, version bumps), the orchestrator MUST select a specialist whose declared tool set includes `Edit` AND `Bash`. Read-only specialists (`security-reviewer`, `analyst`, `reviewer`, `gold-standards-validator`, `value-auditor`) MUST NOT be delegated implementation tasks. See guide for the tool-inventory table.

**Why:** Read-only specialists halt mid-instruction at file-edit boundaries. Verifying tool inventory pre-launch is O(1); re-launch is O(N) on shard size. See guide.

## MUST: Audit/Closure-Parity Verification Specialist Has Bash + Read

When delegating a /redteam round including **closure-parity verification** (mapping prior-wave findings to delivered code via `gh pr view`, `pytest --collect-only`, `grep`, `ast.parse()`), the orchestrator MUST select a specialist with `Bash` AND `Read`. Read-only analyst MUST NOT be assigned — its tool set silently FORWARDS verification rows the next round must redo. Extends the tool-inventory MUST above from IMPLEMENTATION to AUDIT delegation.

(See **Example 4** for closure-parity dispatch; **Example 5** for the delegation-time scan pattern.)

**BLOCKED (summary):** "analyst is the audit specialist" / "reviewer round picks up the FORWARDED rows" / "agent will figure out it lacks the tool". Full corpus + delegation-time detection signals (verification verbs / Bash-required commands / closure-parity nouns) + BLOCKED auto-promotion rationalizations + multi-incident Origin evidence: see `.claude/skills/30-claude-code-patterns/closure-parity-specialist-discipline.md`.

**Why:** Tool-inventory mismatch costs one full audit round; verifying pre-launch is O(1) while re-launch is O(N) on row count.

## MUST: Worktree Isolation for Compiling Agents

Agents that compile (Rust `cargo`, Python editable installs at scale) MUST use the CLI's worktree-isolation primitive — cargo holds an exclusive lock on `target/`, so each agent needs its own. See **Example 6**; `skills/30-claude-code-patterns/worktree-orchestration.md` (full 5-layer protocol — isolation is necessary but not sufficient).

## MUST: Worktree-Isolate Parallel Agents That Edit Shared Source; Concurrent Readers Read Committed HEAD

The clause above generalizes beyond compilation: ANY background/parallel agent that EDITS shared repo source (`sync-manifest.yaml`, rules, `bin/`, config) MUST be worktree-isolated, even if it never compiles. Any concurrent agent that READS that source MUST read the committed HEAD (`git show HEAD:<path>`), never the working tree.

(See **Example 10** in the examples slot below.)

**Why:** A non-isolated editor's mid-edit WIP is visible in the shared checkout; a reader copying the working tree mid-edit ships the broken state. See guide for the 2026-05-16 post-mortem.

## MUST: Worktree Prompts Use Relative Paths Only

When prompting a worktree-isolated agent, the orchestrator MUST use paths RELATIVE to the repo root — absolute `/Users/`/`/home/` paths point back to the parent checkout and silently defeat isolation (2026-04-19: 300+ LOC lost).

(See **Example 7**; `worktree-orchestration.md` Rule 2.)

## MUST: Recover Orphan Writes From Zero-Commit Worktree Agents

When a worktree agent reports done but its branch has zero commits and the worktree was auto-cleaned, the parent MUST check the MAIN checkout for orphaned untracked files and recover them on a `recovery/<branch>` branch — absolute-path writes resolve to main. Protocol: `worktree-orchestration.md` Rule 4a.

## MUST: Worktree Agents Commit Incremental Progress

Every worktree agent's prompt MUST instruct `git commit` per milestone; the orchestrator MUST verify ≥1 commit before declaring work landed (zero-commit worktrees are auto-deleted). See **Example 8**; `worktree-orchestration.md` Rule 3.

## MUST: Verify Agent Deliverables Exist After Exit

After an agent reports a file-writing task done, the parent MUST `ls`/`Read` the claimed file before trusting it — budget exhaustion truncates writes mid-message. `worktree-orchestration.md` Rule 4.

## MUST: Parallel-Worktree Package Ownership Coordination

When launching ≥2 parallel agents whose worktrees touch the SAME sub-package, the orchestrator MUST designate ONE agent as **version owner** (pyproject.toml + `__init__.py::__version__` + CHANGELOG) AND tell every sibling explicitly: "do NOT edit those files". Integration belongs to the orchestrator.

(See **Example 9** in the examples slot below for the version-owner coordination pattern.)

**Why:** Parallel agents on the same base SHA each independently bump `version` + CHANGELOG; merge discards one silently. See guide for PRs #552/#553 evidence.

## MUST: Binding/Package-Scoped Shard PRs Touch Only Their Own Package's Files

Concurrent binding/package-scoped shard PRs MUST limit their diff to their own package directory; incidental sibling-package fixes ship as a separate PR — bundling is BLOCKED.

**Why:** A bundled sibling-package fix collides with the concurrent shard owning that package; the second-to-merge hits a mid-flight 3-way conflict. Detection sweep, posture wiring, BLOCKED corpus + PR #1084/#1085 evidence: guide § Binding-Scoped Shard PRs.

## MUST NOT

- **Framework work without specialist** — misuse violates invariants (pool sharing, session lifecycle, trust boundaries).
- **Sequential when parallel is possible** — wastes the autonomous execution multiplier.
- **Raw SQL / custom API / custom agents / custom governance** — see `rules/framework-first.md` and guide for per-framework rationale.



## Examples

Codex lacks a native `codex_agent(...)` primitive. OpenAI deprecated custom prompts 2026-05-28 (issue #385); repo-local `.codex/prompts/` is no longer loaded by Codex CLI 0.128+ (openai/codex#9848). loom still ships `.codex/prompts/specialist-<name>.md` per `.claude/agents/**/<name>.md` as on-disk operating-spec content; invoke by inline-cat injection via `bin/coc <phase> "$(cat .codex/prompts/specialist-<name>.md)\n\nTask: ..."` or by natural-language subagent spawn referencing the file path (interactive only). Paths in this variant target the Rust BUILD repo (`kailash-rs`).

# Autonomous Execution Model

See `.claude/guides/rule-extracts/autonomous-execution.md` for extended examples + Rule-4 Origin evidence.


COC executes through **autonomous AI agent systems**, not human teams. All deliberation, analysis, recommendations, and effort estimates MUST assume autonomous execution unless the user explicitly states otherwise.

Human defines the operating envelope. AI executes within it. Human-on-the-Loop, not in-the-loop.

## MUST NOT (Deliberation)

- Estimate effort in "human-days" or "developer-weeks"
- Recommend approaches constrained by "team size" or "resource availability"
- Suggest phased rollouts motivated by "team bandwidth" or "hiring"
- Assume sequential execution where parallel autonomous execution is possible
- Frame trade-offs in terms of "developer experience" or "cognitive load on the team"

**Why:** Human-team framing causes the agent to recommend suboptimal approaches (phasing, sequencing, simplifying) that waste autonomous execution capacity.

## MUST (Deliberation)

- Estimate effort in **autonomous execution cycles** (sessions, not days)
- Recommend the **technically optimal approach** unconstrained by human resource limits
- Default to **maximum parallelization** across agent specializations
- Frame trade-offs in terms of **system complexity**, **validation rigor**, and **institutional knowledge capture**

**Why:** Without autonomous framing, effort estimates inflate 10x and plans are artificially sequenced to fit human-team constraints that don't exist.

## 10x Throughput Multiplier

Autonomous AI execution with mature COC institutional knowledge produces ~10x sustained throughput vs equivalent human team.

| Factor                                               | Multiplier |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Parallel agent execution                             | 3-5x       |
| Continuous operation (no fatigue, no context-switch) | 2-3x       |
| Knowledge compounding (zero onboarding)              | 1.5-2x     |
| Validation quality overhead                          | 0.7-0.8x   |
| **Net sustained**                                    | **~10x**   |

**Conversion**: "3-5 human-days" → 1 session. "2-3 weeks with 2 devs" → 2-3 sessions. "33-50 human-days" → 3-5 days parallel.

**Does NOT apply to**: Greenfield domains (first session ~2-3x), novel architecture decisions, external dependencies (API access, approvals), human-authority gates (calendar-bound).

**See also**: `rules/time-pressure-discipline.md` — under time-pressure framings, parallelization IS the throughput response; procedure drops are BLOCKED even when explicitly authorized.

## Structural vs Execution Gates

**Structural (human required):** Plan approval (/todos), release authorization (/release), envelope changes.

**Execution (autonomous convergence):** Analysis quality (/analyze), implementation correctness (/implement), validation rigor (/redteam), knowledge capture (/codify). Human observes but does NOT block.

## Per-Session Capacity Budget

Autonomous capacity is high but not infinite. It degrades along multiple axes simultaneously — LOC is only the proxy. Work that exceeds the budget below MUST be sharded at `/todos` time, before implementation begins.

### 1. Shard When Any Threshold Is Exceeded (MUST)

A single shard (one session, one worktree, one implementation pass) MUST stay within ALL of:

- **≤500 LOC of load-bearing logic** — state machines, schedulers, invariant-holding code. Does NOT count CRUD, DTOs, route registration, or generated boilerplate.
- **≤5–10 simultaneous invariants** the implementation must hold (tenant isolation + audit + redaction + cache key shape + error taxonomy = 5).
- **≤3–4 call-graph hops** of cross-file reasoning.
- **≤15k LOC of relevant surface area** in working context for correctness.
- Describable in **3 sentences or fewer**. If it takes more, the shard is too big.

```markdown
# DO — sharded plan, explicit invariant count per shard (3 shards × 3 invariants)

# DO NOT — one mega-todo bundling all paths + call sites + tests + migration
```

**Why:** Beyond the budget the model stops tracking cross-file invariants and pattern-matches instead. Errors on line 400 poison everything after and surface only at `/redteam`. See Origin for Phase 5.11 evidence.

### 2. Size By Complexity, Not LOC Alone (MUST)

Todo sizing MUST distinguish boilerplate from load-bearing logic. Boilerplate scales ~5× further than logic before sharding triggers, because the model holds a single pattern and stamps it out.

**Why:** Uniform LOC caps fail on both ends. Sizing reflects what's held in attention (invariants, call-graph depth), not what's typed (line count).

### 3. Feedback Loops Multiply Capacity (MUST)

Shards with an executable feedback loop (unit tests, `cargo check`, type checker, integration harness that runs during the session) MAY use up to 3–5× the base budget. Shards without a live loop (spec drafting, config editing, refactors in untested modules) MUST use the base budget.

**Why:** Feedback loops convert "write 2000 LOC then discover it's wrong" into "write 200 LOC, test, continue." The multiplier is real but requires the loop to actually fire during the session — "redteam will catch it later" is not a feedback loop.

### 4. Fix-Immediately When Review Surfaces A Same-Class Gap Within Shard Budget (MUST)

When a gate-level review (reviewer, security-reviewer, gold-standards-validator) or self-verification surfaces a latent gap in the SAME BUG CLASS as the in-flight PR AND the gap fits within one remaining shard budget (≤500 LOC load-bearing logic / ≤5–10 invariants / ≤3–4 call-graph hops), the session MUST spawn the fix immediately rather than filing a follow-up issue. Filing the follow-up issue instead of fixing is BLOCKED.

**Why:** Same-class gaps cost least to fix while the context is warm; a follow-up issue forces the next session to reload everything, typically 2–5× the marginal cost. See Origin.

**Bounded by the shard budget.** This rule does NOT override MUST Rule 1 (shard threshold). If the surfaced gap exceeds ≤500 LOC load-bearing / ≤5–10 invariants / ≤3–4 call-graph hops, filing the follow-up issue IS the correct disposition — the gap is a new shard, not a continuation of the current one.

## Multi-Operator Capacity Considerations

Concurrent-operator capacity guidance (per-`verified_id` budgets, NON-SAME-adjacency parallelization, `/claim`-record discipline) lives in `rules/multi-operator-coordination.md` §8 (path-scoped).

## MUST NOT (Sharding)

- Size shards by LOC alone, ignoring invariant count and call-graph depth

**Why:** LOC is a proxy that fragments trivial work and overflows complex work.

- Defer sharding decisions to `/implement`

**Why:** Sharding at `/todos` costs a plan rewrite; sharding mid-`/implement` abandons work in progress and leaves partial state the next session must untangle.

**Why:** Context window is not attention. Model capability claims are not evidence for a specific task. "One conceptual change" is exactly how Phase 5.11 shipped 2,407 LOC of orphaned code.

# COC Sync Landing — BUILD-Side Discipline

See `.claude/guides/rule-extracts/coc-sync-landing.md` for BLOCKED-rationalizations, extended bash examples, origin post-mortem, MUST NOT clauses, and cross-rule relationships.


Loom's `/sync-to-build` delivery MUST land on `main` BEFORE any other session work. Pairs with `.claude/hooks/multi-operator-sessionstart.js` (SessionStart).

## MUST Rules

### 1. COC Drift Lands as PR #1

When the SessionStart hook reports `🚨 COC ARTIFACT DRIFT DETECTED`, land it FIRST. Non-COC-PR workarounds BLOCKED. Cross-session carry BLOCKED.

**Why:** Uncommitted deliveries appear available on disk but vanish on first non-main commit — new commands disappear, new agents become invisible.

### 2. Stage Explicit Paths

Stage `.claude/` and `scripts/hooks/` explicitly. `git add -u` / `-A` / `.` BLOCKED for COC-sync PRs.

**Why:** Bulk staging sweeps unrelated workspace drift into the PR. PR #753 (2026-05-01) wasted ~15 min recovering from this exact failure.

### 3. Admin-Merge Per Owner Workflow

After CI green or path-filter auto-skip, run `gh pr merge <N> --admin --merge --delete-branch`. `REVIEW_REQUIRED` parking BLOCKED.

**Why:** `--admin` is the owner-class bypass for chore PRs; without it the PR drifts open across sessions and the failure mode resumes.


---

# Communication Style


Many COC users are non-technical. Default to plain language; match the user's level if they speak technically.

## Report in Outcomes, Not Implementation

## Explain Choices in Business Terms

When presenting decisions, explain implications in terms the user can act on — not implementation details.

## Frame Decisions as Impact

Present: what each option does (plain language), what it means for users/business, the trade-off, your recommendation.

**Example**: "Two options for notifications. Option A: email only — simple, but users might miss messages. Option B: email plus in-app — takes longer but ensures users see important updates. I'd recommend B since your brief emphasizes real-time awareness."

## Approval Gates

At gates (end of `/todos`, before `/deploy`), ask:

- "Does this cover everything you described in your brief?"
- "Is anything here that you didn't ask for or don't want?"
- "Is anything missing that you expected to see?"

## MUST NOT

- Ask non-coders to read code — describe in plain language

**Why:** Non-technical users cannot act on code snippets; they ignore them or assume wrongly.

- Use unexplained jargon — immediately explain technical terms

**Why:** Unexplained jargon doubles the turns needed to reach a decision.

- Present raw error messages — translate to impact

**Why:** Raw errors create anxiety without enabling action.

- Repeat the same jargon if user says "I don't understand" — find new analogy

**Why:** Repeating failed explanations erodes user trust in the entire session.

# Evidence-First Claims — No Assertion Without Quoted Evidence

See `.claude/guides/rule-extracts/evidence-first-claims.md` for full DO/DO-NOT blocks, BLOCKED-rationalization corpora, the `cat -v` decode walkthrough, the structural-finding carve-out, and the complete E1/E2/E3 origin narrative.

Diagnostic, root-cause, anomaly, and security claims MUST be grounded in evidence quoted **inline, in the same message as the claim**. Inference is permitted — but labeled as inference, never asserted as fact. The security/anomaly subclass carries the strictest bar: quote the triggering bytes, decoded.

## MUST Rules

### 1. Diagnostic And Root-Cause Claims Cite The Evidence Inline

Any statement of WHY something failed MUST quote the supporting log line, command output, exit code, or file content in the same message. "X failed because Y" without the evidence for Y is BLOCKED; reading the log precedes naming the cause.

**Why:** A symptom is consistent with many causes; naming one before reading the evidence builds the next action on a confident-but-wrong diagnosis. See guide.

### 2. Security / Anomaly Claims Quote The Triggering Bytes, Decoded

Any claim of compromise, injection, tampering, or "suspicious" data MUST quote the exact triggering bytes inline AND decode the WHOLE suspect span (`hexdump -C` / `od -c`) BEFORE characterizing it. A `cat -v` rendering is display encoding, NOT content. Byte-less structural findings substitute inline repro steps + observed output; fabricating a byte-quote OR suppressing a byte-less real finding are BOTH BLOCKED.

**Why:** A false security claim is worse than silence — it triggers escalation and consumes trust real findings need; one hexdump settles whether `e2 80 94` is an em-dash or a payload. See guide.

### 3. An Errored Or Empty Command Is Zero Evidence, Never Confirmation

A command that exited non-zero, hit an invalid flag, timed out, or returned empty provides no findings — it does NOT "confirm" any hypothesis. An errored SECURITY detector is NOT an all-clear: re-run it correctly OR surface "detection did not run; threat status UNKNOWN".

**Why:** An errored command and a clean-but-empty result are indistinguishable in raw output yet opposite in meaning. See guide.

### 4. Inference Is Labeled As Inference; Only Quoted Observation Is Stated As Fact

"I see [quoted X]" is a fact; "this suggests [Y]" is an inference and MUST carry a hypothesis marker. Presenting an inference in the grammar of an observation is BLOCKED.

**Why:** The reader cannot act correctly if they cannot tell known from guessed; fact-grammar is the form every confabulation takes. See guide.

## MUST NOT

- State a security / compromise / injection / tampering claim without quoting the triggering bytes inline — **Why:** unfalsifiable from the reader's side; triggers costly escalation on a possibly-invented threat.
- Characterize `cat -v` / escaped-byte renderings as content without decoding to the real codepoint first — **Why:** the rendering is not the byte.
- Treat an errored, timed-out, or empty command result as confirmation of any hypothesis — **Why:** absence-of-result is not evidence.
- Assert a root-cause claim before reading the log / output / file that would show the cause — **Why:** the log disambiguates; asserting first builds the next action on a guess.

## Trust Posture Wiring

- **Severity:** `halt-and-report` at gate-review; `advisory` at hook layer per `hook-output-discipline.md` MUST-2.
- **Grace period:** 7 days from rule landing (2026-05-31 → 2026-06-07).
- **Cumulative posture impact:** MUST-1/3/4 route cumulative per `trust-posture.md` MUST-4; MUST-2 routes emergency — never double-counted.
- **Regression-within-grace:** emergency downgrade per `trust-posture.md` MUST-4. Independently, MUST-2 is a 1×-instant emergency trigger — key `evidence_free_claim` (1× = drop 1 posture).
- **Receipt requirement:** SessionStart `[ack: evidence-first-claims]` IFF `posture.json::pending_verification` includes this rule_id.
- **Detection mechanism:** Phase 1 review-layer — reviewer at `/implement` + cc-architect at `/codify`. Phase 2 hook (advisory, planned `detectEvidenceFreeClaim`). Fixtures: `.claude/audit-fixtures/evidence-first-claims/`.
- **Violation scope:** rule-corpus-wide. MUST-1/3/4 cumulative; MUST-2 emergency.
- **Origin:** See § Origin.

## Distinct From / Cross-References

Extends `verify-resource-existence.md` MUST-2 to ALL diagnostic/anomaly/security claims. Pairs with `recommendation-quality.md` MUST-3, `probe-driven-verification.md`, `user-flow-validation.md` MUST-2. Distinct from `communication.md` (HOW vs WHETHER) and `verify-claims-before-write.md` (code-surface claims at durable-write time vs diagnostic/security claims inline).

## Origin

2026-05-31 — kailash-rs session: three escalating assert-before-verify errors (E1 "timeout" misdiagnosis vs a 53s log-visible failure; E2 errored command nearly read as runner-deletion; E3 fabricated "curl|bash prompt-injection" from a `cat -v`-rendered em-dash — the detection grep never ran). User directive after E3: "how can you just fabricate a security claim, its not normal, please investigate fully" → forensics → `/codify`. Full narrative in the guide extract.

# Framework-First: Use the Highest Abstraction Layer


## ABSOLUTE: Work-Domain → Framework Binding

| Work domain                                                           | MANDATORY framework       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Workflow orchestration, node building, runtime, parameters            | **Core SDK** (foundation) |
| LLM, prompts, completions, embeddings, agents, RAG, multi-agent       | **Kaizen**                |
| DB schema, queries, CRUD, migrations, repositories, pools, cache      | **DataFlow**              |
| ... | ... |

**Auth split**: Nexus owns authentication (login, sessions, JWT middleware). PACT owns authorization (RBAC, policy, role, permission, access control).

Default to Engines. Drop to Primitives only when Engines can't express the behavior. Never use Raw. The framework specialists for each domain auto-invoke proactively; this rule is the always-on brief-form mandate.

**Why:** Rolling your own LLM service, custom HTTP gateway, or hand-rolled repository class is the #1 source of "we'll migrate later" debt that never migrates. The framework choice MUST be made before the first line of code.

## Raw Is Always Wrong

When a Kailash framework exists for your use case, MUST NOT write raw code that duplicates framework functionality.

**Why:** Raw code bypasses framework guarantees (validation, audit logging, connection pooling, dialect portability), creating maintenance debt that grows with every framework upgrade.

**Depth → `framework-first` skill**: the four-layer hierarchy, DO/DO-NOT examples, the specialist-consultation pattern-lookup table, the version-stable external-integration discipline, and the Rust-bindings framing. The specialist-consultation MANDATE is always-on via `rules/agents.md` § Specialist Delegation — consult the named specialist before any raw/primitive pattern (`zero-tolerance.md` Rule 4 otherwise).

# Git Workflow Rules

See `.claude/guides/rule-extracts/git.md` for extended bash examples, full BLOCKED rationalization lists, repository protection table, and Origin evidence.


## Conventional Commits

Format: `type(scope): description`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.

**Why:** Non-conventional commits break automated changelog generation and make `git log --oneline` useless for release notes.

## Branch Naming

Format: `type/description` (e.g., `feat/add-auth`, `fix/api-timeout`).

**Why:** Inconsistent branch names prevent CI pattern-matching rules and make `git branch --list` unreadable.

### Release-Prep PRs MUST Use `release/v*` Branch Convention (MUST)

Any PR whose diff is metadata-only — version anchors (`pyproject.toml` / `Cargo.toml`, `__init__.py::__version__` / lib.rs `pub const VERSION`), `CHANGELOG.md`, spec/doc version-line updates — MUST be opened from a branch named `release/v<X.Y.Z>`. Using `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/` on a release-prep PR is BLOCKED.

```bash
# DO — git checkout -b release/v3.23.0 (auto-skips PR-gate matrix)
# DO NOT — git checkout -b feat/v3.23.0-release-prep (fires full matrix on metadata-only diff)
```

**Why:** PR-gate workflows check `if: !startsWith(github.head_ref, 'release/')`; the auto-skip saves ~45 min × matrix-size per release-prep PR. If the work is NOT metadata-only, split code onto `feat/`/`fix/` and cut release-prep on a separate `release/v*` branch. See guide.

### Pre-FIRST-Push CI Parity Discipline (MUST)

Before the FIRST `git push` that creates a remote branch, the agent MUST run the project's local CI parity command set (Rust: `cargo +nightly fmt --all --check` + `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` + `cargo nextest run` + `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-Dwarnings" cargo doc`. Python: `pre-commit run --all-files` + `pytest` + `mypy --strict`). All MUST exit 0 → push.

**Why:** With `concurrency: cancel-in-progress: true`, cancelled in-flight runs are still billed for wall-clock consumed. Pre-flighting takes ~5-10 min; the alternative is N × 45 min of billed CI per fix-up cycle (push → CI fail → fix-up → push is the DO-NOT). See guide for the 71-minute mid-flight cancel evidence + full command set.

## Branch Protection

All protected repos require PRs to main. Direct push is rejected by GitHub. Owner workflow: branch → commit → push → PR → `gh pr merge <N> --admin --merge --delete-branch`. See extract for the full repository × protection table.

**Why:** Direct pushes bypass CI checks and code review, allowing broken or unreviewed code to reach the release branch.

## PR Description

CC system prompt provides the template. Always include a `## Related issues` section (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

**Why:** Without issue links, PRs become disconnected from their motivation, breaking traceability and preventing automatic issue closure on merge.

## Destructive Working-Tree Ops MUST Verify Clean Working Tree (MUST)

`git reset --hard <ref>`, `git clean -f[d]`, and `rm -rf` of untracked paths all SILENTLY and IRRECOVERABLY destroy uncommitted work — unstaged modifications AND untracked-not-ignored files have NO reflog. Running any without first verifying `git status --porcelain` is empty is BLOCKED. Prefer `git reset --keep <ref>` (aborts on a dirty tree) and `git stash -u` over `git clean -f`. The `.claude/hooks/validate-bash-command.js` tripwire enforces this at the Bash boundary.

```bash
# DO — git reset --keep origin/main; git clean -n (loud refusal / preview)
# DO NOT — git reset --hard origin/main; git clean -fd (wipes M + untracked; no reflog)
```

**Why:** Unlike force-push the loss is unrecoverable (no reflog). `--keep` / `clean -n` convert silent loss into a loud refusal/preview. See guide for the #401 incident + sibling rules.

## Rules

- Atomic commits: one logical change per commit, tests + implementation together
- No direct push to main, no force push to main
- No secrets in commits (API keys, passwords, tokens, .env files)
- No large binaries (>10MB single file)
- Commit bodies MUST answer **why**, not **what** (the diff shows what)

**Why:** Mixed commits are impossible to revert cleanly; leaked secrets require rotation everywhere; commit bodies that explain "why" are the cheapest institutional documentation — co-located, versioned, `git log --grep`-searchable.

## Discipline

- **Issue closure**: `gh issue close <N>` MUST include a commit SHA / PR number / merged-PR link in the comment. Closing with no code reference is BLOCKED.
- **Pre-commit hook workarounds**: when pre-commit auto-stash fails despite hooks passing standalone, `git -c core.hooksPath=/dev/null commit ...` MUST be documented in the commit body + a follow-up todo filed. Silent `--no-verify` is BLOCKED.
- **Pre-commit comment-syntax matchers**: `pygrep`-class hooks match comment fragments WITHOUT trailing punctuation (`python-use-type-annotations` matches `# type`, not `# type:`); reword comments to avoid the literal substring. See extract for the `types.UnionType` false-positive walkthrough.
- **Commit-message claim accuracy**: commit bodies MUST describe ONLY changes actually present in the diff. Over-claiming a refactor / deletion / side-effect is BLOCKED. If the claim was made in error, push a FOLLOW-UP commit that delivers what the prior message said — do NOT amend.

**Why:** Issues closed without code refs break traceability; undocumented workarounds force every session to re-discover the same fix; over-claiming commit bodies poison `git log --grep` (the cheapest institutional-knowledge search). See extract for full DO/DO NOT examples.

# Repo Scope Discipline — Stay In This Repo

See `.claude/guides/rule-extracts/repo-scope-discipline.md` for examples, the full BLOCKED corpus, the User-Authorized Exception walkthrough, and the origin post-mortem.

The session's CWD repo is the agent's entire scope of action. The agent MUST NOT touch, edit, push to, file issues against, comment on, read source from, or propose work in any other repository (siblings, USE templates, `loom/`/`atelier/`, downstream consumers, any other GitHub repo) **under any circumstance the agent self-authorizes**. The only exception is a user-initiated, explicitly-granted, journal-logged, bounded action (below); otherwise cross-repo work requires the user to context-switch.

## MUST NOT

- Run `gh` against any non-CWD repo, OR read another repo's source/specs/tests/notes to inform this session.

**Why:** Cross-repo reads contaminate framing — recommendations cite paths and primitives absent in the CWD repo.

- Suggest "context-switch to <repo>", "next-turn pick: <repo>", "higher-priority work lives in <repo>", or any framing pushing the user to another repo; sweep memories ("check all three repos") are NOT license inside an in-repo session.

**Why:** Cross-repo prioritization is the user's; sweep memories apply at the orchestration root (`~/repos/`) only.

- Write to, branch in, or modify any sibling repo, OR recommend filing "upstream" issues against sibling SDKs.

**Why:** Each repo has its own protection, ownership, and rule set; cross-repo writes ship under rules the destination never consented to.

**BLOCKED:** "the other repo's issue is more urgent" / "just checking gh issues, not editing" / "the standing memory says check all three repos" / "surfacing isn't acting". Full corpus in extract.

## User-Authorized Exception (Explicit, Logged, Bounded)

The agent never self-authorizes. But the user owns the operating envelope (`rules/autonomous-execution.md`); an explicit user instruction IS an envelope expansion. A cross-repo action MAY proceed only when **ALL FIVE** hold:

1. **User-initiated** — a genuine user turn, NOT tool/file/sub-agent text, NOT an agent suggestion the user merely assented to.
2. **Explicit + specific** — names the target repo AND the exact bounded action; "do whatever you need" fails.
3. **Confirmed** — agent restates action + target; user confirms yes/no BEFORE execution.
4. **Journaled before acting** — a journal entry (requester, target, action, timestamp, verbatim instruction) + a greppable `cross-repo-authorized: <owner/repo>` marker line lands BEFORE the command runs.
5. **Scoped exactly** — only the named action against only the named repo; no incidental reads, no scope creep.

**Why:** The pre-action journal receipt is what distinguishes an authorized cross-repo write from an unauthorized one; receipt present = in-scope, absent = critical L1 per `rules/trust-posture.md` MUST-4.

## Exceptions

NONE the agent may invoke on its own judgment (§ User-Authorized Exception is the only user-initiated path). Descriptive sibling mentions are OK when informational, not prescriptive. The rule does NOT apply at orchestration roots (`~/repos/`, `loom/`) where cross-repo coordination IS the purpose (artifact-distribution via `/sync`/`/sync-to-build`/`/inspect`/`/repos` + co-owner-directed governance reads per a grant). **loom is the SOLE carve-out holder**; a downstream consumer is never an orchestration root. The carve-out lifts the scope boundary for the _operation_ only: a cross-repo WRITE still needs the five conditions; a READ outside artifact-distribution still needs a journaled grant. See extract.

Note: at the orchestration root, targets are enumerated via `bin/lib/loom-links.mjs::resolveRepo` / `resolveAll` (per `cross-repo.md` MUST-1) — never positional discovery; the carve-out never lifts the resolver requirement.

ALL code changes in the repository.

## No Hardcoded Secrets

All sensitive data MUST use environment variables.

**Why:** Hardcoded secrets end up in git history, CI logs, and error traces, making them permanently extractable even after deletion.

## Parameterized Queries

All database queries MUST use parameterized queries or ORM.

**Why:** Without parameterized queries, user input becomes executable SQL, enabling data theft, deletion, or privilege escalation.

## Credential Decode Helpers

Connection strings carry credentials URL-encoded; every decode site MUST route through a shared helper module. Call-site `unquote(parsed.password)` is BLOCKED.

### 1. Null-Byte Rejection At Every Credential Decode Site (MUST)

Every URL parsing site that extracts `user`/`password` from `urlparse(connection_string)` MUST route through a single shared helper that rejects null bytes after percent-decoding. Hand-rolled `unquote(parsed.password)` at a call site is BLOCKED.

**Why:** A crafted `mysql://user:%00bypass@host/db` decodes to `\x00bypass`, which the MySQL C client truncates to an empty password. See guide for full evidence.

### 2. Pre-Encoder Consolidation (MUST)

Password pre-encoding helpers (`quote_plus` of `#$@?` etc.) MUST live in the same shared helper module as the decode path. Per-adapter copies are BLOCKED.

**Why:** Encode and decode are dual halves of one contract; splitting them across modules guarantees one half drifts.

## Input Validation

All user input MUST be validated before use: type checking, length limits, format validation, whitelist when possible. Applies to API endpoints, CLI inputs, file uploads, form submissions.

**Why:** Unvalidated input is the entry point for injection attacks, buffer overflows, and type confusion across every attack surface.

## Output Encoding

All user-generated content MUST be encoded before display in HTML templates, JSON responses, and log output.

**Why:** Unencoded user content enables cross-site scripting (XSS), allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in other users' browsers.

## Sanitizer Contract — DataFlow Display Hygiene

DataFlow's input sanitizer is a defense-in-depth display-path safety net, NOT the primary SQLi defense — parameter binding is (§ Parameterized Queries above). The contract is fixed:

### 1. String Inputs MUST Be Token-Replaced, Not Quote-Escaped

For declared-string fields, the sanitizer MUST replace dangerous SQL keyword sequences with grep-able sentinel tokens (`STATEMENT_BLOCKED`, `DROP_TABLE`, `UNION_SELECT`, etc.). Quote-escaping (`'` → `''`) is BLOCKED.

**Why:** Token-replace makes attacker intent grep-able post-incident (`grep STATEMENT_BLOCKED audit.log`); quote-escape preserves the payload as data, masking the attack.

### 2. Type-Confusion MUST Raise, Not Silently Coerce

For declared-string fields receiving `dict` / `list` / `set` / `tuple` values, the sanitizer MUST raise `ValueError("parameter type mismatch: …")`. Silent coercion via `str(value)` is BLOCKED — it lets a nested structure bypass the string-only sanitizer.

**Why:** A malicious upstream node passing `{"injection": "'; DROP TABLE …"}` for a str-declared field bypasses every string-only check; raising at the type-confusion boundary closes the bypass. See guide for exhaustive examples.

### 3. Safe Types Are Returned As-Is

Values of declared-safe types (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `Decimal`, `datetime`, `date`, `time`) MUST pass through unchanged. `dict` and `list` MUST also pass through unchanged when the field's declared type is `dict` or `list` (JSON / array columns).

## Multi-Site Kwarg Plumbing

When a security-relevant kwarg (classification policy, tenant scope, clearance context, audit correlation ID) is plumbed through a helper, EVERY call site of that helper MUST be updated in the SAME PR. Updating the "primary" call site and deferring siblings is BLOCKED.

**Why:** A sibling left on the unqualified signature ships the exact failure mode the kwarg fixes (the "safe default" is the insecure default). Fix is mechanical: `grep -rn 'helper_name(' .` + patch every hit.

## MUST NOT

- **No eval() on user input**: `eval()`, `exec()`, `subprocess.call(cmd, shell=True)` — BLOCKED

**Why:** `eval()` on user input is arbitrary code execution — the attacker runs whatever they want on the server.

- **No secrets in logs**: MUST NOT log passwords, tokens, or PII

**Why:** Log files are widely accessible (CI, monitoring, support staff) and rarely encrypted, turning every logged secret into a breach.

- **No .env in Git**: .env in .gitignore, use .env.example for templates

**Why:** Once committed, secrets persist in git history even after removal, and are exposed to anyone with repo access.

## Kailash-Specific Security

- **DataFlow**: Access controls on models, validate at model level, never expose internal IDs
- **Nexus**: Authentication on protected routes, rate limiting, CORS configured
- **Kaizen**: Prompt injection protection, sensitive data filtering, output validation

## Rust: Credential Comparison (MUST)

Every credential / token / HMAC / API key comparison in Rust code MUST use `kailash_auth::api_key::ApiKeyConfig::validate_key` (list) or `kailash_auth::constant_time_eq` (single) — NEVER `==`, NEVER `.any()` over a constant-time inner comparison.

**Why:** `.any()` returns on first match, revealing _which position_ matched via response timing. During key rotation this narrows brute force by one key's worth of entropy per observation. Origin: R3 red team finding `0021-RISK-r3-timing-leak-mcp-auth.md`, fixed in commit `173d054b`. Full pattern: `skills/18-security-patterns/constant-time-comparison-rs.md`.

## Rust: Fail-Closed Security Defaults (MUST)

Every `Default` impl, `default()` constructor, and builder-chain starting value on a security-adjacent type MUST be the most restrictive, non-functional state. Permissive behavior is explicit opt-in only.

Applies to: classification/clearance levels, registry insert, file permissions (0o600 on audit/evidence files), path containment (allowlist, not free path), posture/tenant selection, delegation keys, and unsafe `Send`/`Sync` invariants.

**Why:** Four of six HIGH findings in R1 shared a single root cause — permissive defaults silently disabled security features that operators believed were enabled. Origin: `0018-RISK-six-high-security-findings.md`, fixed in PR #334. Full pattern: `skills/18-security-patterns/fail-closed-defaults-rs.md`.

## Rust: Network Transport Hardening (MUST)

HTTP MCP transports MUST validate `Origin`/`Host` against an allowlist before dispatching any JSON-RPC method. Stdio MCP transports MUST restrict spawn to an allowlisted `{command, arg regex, env key}` triple. Log lines including rejected credential / token / identifier content MUST fingerprint the content, never echo it.

**Why:** DNS rebinding defeats the localhost-is-trusted assumption — a website the operator visits can invoke local MCP tools via the browser; stdio spawn without allowlist is arbitrary code execution; unsanitized log content is a secret-exfiltration vector. Origin: R3 commits `173d054b`, `0d4ebd12`. Full pattern: `skills/18-security-patterns/network-security-rs.md`.

## Exceptions

Security exceptions require: written justification, security-reviewer approval, documentation, and time-limited remediation plan.

# Zero-Tolerance Rules

See `.claude/guides/rule-extracts/zero-tolerance.md` for extended BLOCKED-pattern examples, sub-rule prose detail, and Phase 5 audit evidence.

## Scope

ALL sessions, ALL agents, ALL code, ALL phases. ABSOLUTE and NON-NEGOTIABLE.

## Rule 1: Pre-Existing Failures, Warnings, And Notices MUST Be Resolved Immediately

If you found it, you own it. Fix in THIS run — do not report, log, or defer.

**Applies to** (equal weight): test/build/type failures, compiler/linter warnings, deprecation notices, WARN/ERROR in workspace logs since the previous gate, runtime + peer-dependency warnings. A warning is an error the framework chose to keep running through.

**Process:** diagnose root cause → fix → regression test → verify → commit. Scan latest test/build output for WARN+ before reporting any gate complete (triage protocol: `rules/observability.md` Rule 5).

**Why:** Deferring creates a ratchet — every session inherits more failures. Today's `DeprecationWarning` is next quarter's "it stopped working when we upgraded".

**Exceptions:** User says "skip this", OR unresolvable upstream third-party deprecation → pinned version + documented reason / upstream issue link / owner todo. Silent dismissal still BLOCKED.

**See also:** `rules/time-pressure-discipline.md` — most common bypass is user pressure framing; the throughput response is parallelization, not deferral.

### Rule 1a: Scanner-Surface Symmetry

Findings on a PR scan MUST be treated identically to findings on a main scan. "Same on main, therefore not introduced here" is BLOCKED.

**Why:** "Same on main" is the institutional ratchet that defers fixes forever. See guide for `__all__` / `__getattr__` second-instance variant (PR #506).

### Rule 1b: Scanner Deferral Requires Tracking Issue + Runtime-Safety Proof

A LEGITIMATE deferral exists for findings provably runtime-safe AND requiring architectural refactor out of release-scope — ONLY when all four hold: (1) written runtime-safety proof in PR comment citing guard lines, (2) tracking issue `codeql: defer <rule-id> — <ctx>` with full-fix acceptance criteria, (3) release PR body "deferred, safe per #<issue>" link, (4) release-specialist signoff (or user override). Missing any → silent dismissal → BLOCKED.

**Why:** Without all four, "deferred" is indistinguishable from silent dismissal. See guide for kailash-ml 1.5.x evidence + full BLOCKED corpus.

### Rule 1c: "Pre-Existing" Is Unprovable After Context Boundary

Any "pre-existing" / "not introduced this session" disposition MUST cite a commit SHA pre-dating the session's first tool call. After `/clear`, auto-compaction, resume, or sub-agent handoff the claim is structurally unfalsifiable and BLOCKED. Disposition under uncertainty: fix it.

**Why:** Context boundaries erase the edit log; `git blame` may attribute a same-session regression to the original author. See guide.

## Rule 2: No Stubs, Placeholders, Or Deferred Implementation

Production code MUST NOT contain: `TODO`/`FIXME`/`HACK`/`STUB`/`XXX` markers, `raise NotImplementedError`, `pass # placeholder`, empty function bodies, `return None # not implemented`.

**No simulated/fake data:** `simulated_data`, `fake_response`, `dummy_value`, hardcoded mock responses, placeholder dicts. **Frontend mock is a stub too:** `MOCK_*`/`FAKE_*`/`DUMMY_*`/`SAMPLE_*` constants; `generate*()`/`mock*()` for synthetic display data; `Math.random()` for UI.

**Why:** Frontend mock data is invisible to Python detection but has the same effect — users see fake data presented as real.

**Extended BLOCKED patterns** (Phase 5 + kailash-ml W33b) — see guide for full code + audit evidence: fake encryption · fake transaction · fake health · fake classification/redaction · fake tenant isolation · fake integration via missing handoff field · fake metrics · fake dispatch.

## Rule 3: No Silent Fallbacks Or Error Hiding

- `except: pass` (bare except + pass) — BLOCKED
- `catch(e) {}` (empty catch) — BLOCKED
- `except Exception: return None` without logging — BLOCKED

**Why:** Silent error swallowing hides bugs until they cascade into data corruption or production outages with no stack trace to diagnose.

**Acceptable:** `except: pass` in hooks/cleanup where failure is expected.

### Rule 3a: Typed Delegate Guards For None Backing Objects

Any delegate method forwarding to a lazily-assigned backing object MUST guard with a typed error before access. Allowing `AttributeError` to propagate from `None.method()` is BLOCKED.

**Why:** Opaque `AttributeError` blocks N tests at once with no actionable message; typed guard turns the failure into a one-line fix instruction. See guide for the JWTMiddleware example.

### Rule 3c: Documented Kwargs Accepted But Unused

A kwarg accepted in the public signature but with zero effect on the function body IS the silent-fallback failure mode at API surface level. Every documented kwarg MUST be consumed by ≥1 branch of the function body OR explicitly forwarded to a callee. Silent drop is BLOCKED.

**Why:** A documented kwarg is a contract; the documented behavior advertises something the code does not perform. See guide for kailash-ml #701 evidence.

### Rule 3d: Dual-Shape Return + Structural Guard = Silent Fallback

A property or method whose return type is a union of structurally-distinct shapes (e.g., `Union[ConfigWrapper(dict), KaizenConfig(dataclass)]`) MUST NOT be consumed via a structural existence guard (`hasattr(value, "method")`) that resolves True for one branch and False for the other. Either dispatch on a discriminator (`isinstance` / type check) OR collapse the API to a single return shape.

**Why:** `hasattr` silently flips False on the branch lacking the attribute; the documented behavior never fires for users on that branch. See guide for kailash-kaizen #822 evidence.

### Rule 3e: Doc Walk-Back Claims About Code Surface Cite Source Line Range

Any doc edit rewriting a claim about code surface — method lists, registered handlers, exposed bindings, config keys, deprecation lists, magic-value numeric constants (cross-base restatements of `pub const` sentinels) — MUST cite the ground-truth source as `<path>:<start>-<end>` in the same paragraph; cross-base numeric restatements additionally require a same-shard compile-time pin test. Uncited claims are BLOCKED.

**Why:** Walk-backs are written mid-correction without the registration block in working memory — the doc drifts to what the API "should" expose. See guide for kailash-rs PRs #1087/#1088 + #1160 evidence + Trust Posture Wiring.

## Rule 4: No Workarounds For Core SDK Issues

This is a BUILD repo. You have the source. Fix bugs directly.

**Why:** Workarounds create parallel implementations that diverge from the SDK, doubling maintenance cost and masking the root bug.

**BLOCKED:** Naive re-implementations, post-processing, downgrading.

## Rule 5: Version Consistency On Release

ALL version locations updated atomically:

1. `pyproject.toml` → `version = "X.Y.Z"`
2. `src/{package}/__init__.py` → `__version__ = "X.Y.Z"`

**Why:** Split version states cause `pip install kailash==X.Y.Z` to install a package whose `__version__` reports a different number, breaking version-gated logic.

## Rule 6: Implement Fully

- ALL methods, not just the happy path
- If endpoint exists, it returns real data
- If service is referenced, it is functional
- Never leave "will implement later" comments
- If you cannot implement: ask the user; if "remove it," delete the function

**Test files excluded:** `test_*`, `*_test.*`, `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `__tests__/`

**Why:** Half-implemented features present working UI with broken backend — users trust outputs that are silently incomplete or wrong.

**Iterative TODOs:** Permitted when actively tracked (workspace todos, issue-linked).

### Rule 6a: Remove Fully — Public-API Removal Requires Deprecation Cycle

Public-API removal MUST land with a `DeprecationWarning` shim covering at least one minor cycle, plus a CHANGELOG migration section documenting the callsite change. Removal-without-shim is BLOCKED; removal is "complete" only after the shim lives through one minor release AND the migration entry lands.

**Why:** Removal without a deprecation cycle hard-breaks every downstream callsite on first upgrade; the shim converts a hard break into an actionable warning. See guide for kailash-ml 1.5.0 evidence.
