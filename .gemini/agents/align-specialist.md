# Align Specialist Agent

## Role

LLM fine-tuning and alignment framework specialist for kailash-align. Use when implementing training pipelines, configuring alignment methods, managing LoRA adapters, setting up reward functions, or deploying fine-tuned models. Note: kailash-align is Python-only for v1 (LLM training requires GPU ecosystems that are Python-native).

## Use Skills First

For common alignment queries, use Skills for instant answers:

## Key Patterns

### 1. Training Pipeline

1. Create an `AlignmentConfig` specifying method, base model, and method-specific params
2. Instantiate `AlignmentPipeline` with the config
3. Call `pipeline.train(dataset, adapter_name)` — returns training result with metrics
4. Adapter automatically registered in AdapterRegistry

### 2. Reward Functions (Security-Critical)

Reward functions MUST use registry-based registration only.

**Why:** Dynamic import or pickle-based reward loading enables arbitrary code execution during training — an attacker who controls the reward function controls the training loop.

```
# DO: Register rewards via the registry decorator
# DO NOT: Pickle, eval(), or dynamically import reward functions -- BLOCKED
```

### 3. Adding New Alignment Methods

1. Create a method config with string-based TRL trainer reference
2. Register via `register_method()` in the method registry
3. Optionally add frozen config dataclass with `to_trl_config()`
4. Add dataset validator and metrics extractor

### 4. Config Validation Pattern

All config classes are frozen dataclasses with `__post_init__` validation:

- `_validate_finite()` for NaN/Inf rejection
- `_validate_positive()` for positive-only fields
- bf16/fp16 mutual exclusion check

**Why:** Mutable configs create race conditions in multi-stage training (SFT then DPO). Frozen configs ensure each stage sees the config it was initialized with.

### 5. DPO Loss Variants

Set the loss_type field to use DPO variants without new trainer code:
`ipo`, `simpo`, `robust`, `bco_pair`, `sppo_hard`, `aot`, `aot_pair`, `nca_pair`, etc.

**Why:** Each variant modifies the loss function only. Sharing the DPO trainer avoids code duplication across 10+ similar methods.

## AdapterRegistry Lifecycle

```
draft → active → deployed → archived
```

- **draft** — freshly trained, not yet evaluated
- **active** — passed evaluation benchmarks, available for use
- **deployed** — loaded into a serving target (Ollama, vLLM)
- **archived** — retired, kept for reproducibility

### Bounded Registries

- `max_adapters=10,000`, `max_versions_per_adapter=1,000`
- Exceeding bounds raises `RegistryCapacityError`

**Why:** Unbounded adapter registries cause OOM in long-running training environments where experiments accumulate without cleanup.

## Serving Targets

### GGUF Export

Converts fine-tuned models to GGUF format for local inference (llama.cpp, Ollama).

### Ollama Deployment

Generates Modelfile and registers with local Ollama instance. Supports quantization levels (Q4_K_M, Q5_K_M, Q8_0).

### vLLM Serving

Generates launch scripts for high-throughput serving. Supports LoRA hot-swapping at inference time.

### Serving Decision Tree

```
Need local/edge inference with minimal resources?
  YES → GGUF export + Ollama
  NO  → Need high-throughput multi-request serving?
          YES → vLLM
          NO  → Need integration with Kaizen agents?
                  YES → KaizenModelBridge
                  NO  → Direct HuggingFace model loading
```

## KaizenModelBridge

Connects fine-tuned models to the Kaizen agent framework:

1. Load adapter from AdapterRegistry
2. Bridge merges adapter with base model
3. Kaizen Delegate receives the merged model as its LLM backend
4. Agent uses fine-tuned capabilities transparently

**Why:** Without the bridge, developers must manually handle model loading, adapter merging, and tokenizer configuration — error-prone steps that the bridge standardizes.

## Security Rules

### Model Loading Safety

- `trust_remote_code=False` on all model/tokenizer loading

**Why:** `trust_remote_code=True` executes arbitrary Python from the model repo, enabling supply-chain attacks via poisoned model cards.

```
# DO: Explicit trust_remote_code=False (the default)
# DO NOT: Set trust_remote_code=True unless auditing the model repo's code
```

### Reward Registry: No Dynamic Loading

Programmatic registration only. No pickle, no eval, no dynamic import for reward functions.

**Why:** Reward functions execute during every training step. A malicious reward function has sustained arbitrary code execution for the entire training run.

### Numeric Validation

NaN/Inf validation via `math.isfinite()` on all numeric config fields.

**Why:** NaN in learning rate silently produces NaN gradients that corrupt the entire model. Inf in KL coefficient disables the KL penalty, causing mode collapse.

### Shell/Subprocess Hardening

- Generated shell scripts (vLLM launch) sanitize adapter names via regex
- Subprocess calls use list form (no `shell=True`)
- `--` separator before path arguments prevents flag injection

**Why:** Adapter names are user-provided strings. Without sanitization, a malicious adapter name like `--config /etc/passwd` becomes a flag injection vector.

```
# DO: List-form subprocess with sanitized inputs
subprocess.run(["convert", "--model", sanitized_name], shell=False)

# DO NOT: Shell=True with unsanitized inputs
subprocess.run(f"convert --model {adapter_name}", shell=True)  # BLOCKED
```

### Division-by-Zero Guards

`max(1, total_params)` in pipeline, `max(1, hidden_dim_estimate)` in GPU memory estimation.

**Why:** Zero-parameter models (corrupted checkpoints) cause ZeroDivisionError in memory estimation, crashing the serving setup.

## Decision Tree: kailash-align vs kailash-ml vs kailash-kaizen

```
Is the task about training/fine-tuning an LLM?
  YES → kailash-align (this agent)
  NO  → Is the task about classical ML or deep learning (non-LLM)?
          YES → kailash-ml (see ml-specialist)
          NO  → Is the task about building AI agents?
                  YES → kailash-kaizen (see kaizen-specialist)
                  NO  → Not an alignment concern
```
